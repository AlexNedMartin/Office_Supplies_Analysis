# Office Supplies Analysis

This is my Office Supplies Descriptive Analytics project.

Offuture is an online global office and technology supply store. It has been operating since 2010 and delivers high-quality office furniture, technology, and office supplies worldwide.

Offuture has provided a data file of its sales data from 2011 to 2015. They would like a descriptive analytics project to detail their performance during that time period.

Key Objectives:
* Load data, quality check & prepare (ETL)
* Visualisation and storytelling (Tableau)

SQL queries and ETL stages are found in this repository.
